# Hyper WLight Drifter

A selfremake of the indie game Hyper Light Drifter in web form using like HTML, TS, and SCSS. 
This project uses the original game's asset in order to create a similar game and mechanics.

## Additional Contents
The first page of the website consists of a HTML page that is made to advertise the game, several elements like
- Audio Player with the game's soundtrack
- GIFs advertising the game
- Videos promoting the game
are included in the website.


In the game itself, I added/remade several new elements such as:
- Coin based system based on the original game's modules system
- Infinite map along with randomly generated structures
- Cheat codes
- and more!

## Website
The deployed version of the website can be previewed here:
