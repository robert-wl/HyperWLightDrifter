# Hyper WLight Drifter
A self-remake of the indie game Hyper Light Drifter in web form using HTML, TypeScript, and SCSS. This project uses the original game's assets to create a similar game and mechanics.

## Additional Contents
The first page of the website includes elements such as:
- An audio player with the game's soundtrack.
- GIFs advertising the game.
- Videos promoting the game.

In the game itself, several new elements have been added or remade, including:
- A coin-based system based on the original game's modules system.
- An infinite map with randomly generated structures.
- Cheat codes.
- And more!
